   "Matthew has been great with helping me understand cypto.  I did not know much bout it when I first heard Matthew talk bout it. I met Matthew at 2nd event and knew that I was missing the boat if i didn't start investing and began looking into it. Now is like the 2nd change to invest in cypto.   Matthew opened my eyes to it .Prices are at all time lows and prime for investing. I have hired Matthew to help me in my investments and it's been a pleasure working with him.  He knows the market I have first hand communication with him. Matthew went over strategies and helped me pick options that benefit my  particulars.  We came up with a plan we believe  works for my portfolio.  I thank u Matthew for all your help and wisdom in bringing prosperity into my life and wish u the same. I believe in Matthew s passion.  We have talked friday night's, sat nights texting bout cypto. He lives for this stuff and I wouldn't want anyone else in my corner other than him.  Since getting to know Matthew we have gotten even closer .I consider him a great friend and someone whom I trust . Bless u brother ."

	 "The biggest challenge in the world of investing is risk. What to buy,when to buy,where to buy,how much to buy and with whom to do business with. Mr Sanders provided me abundantly with the amount of expertise, caring and trust , so I can sleep calmly at night.
	 Thank You Sir"

      "Matthew worked for me as a math tutor and coaching my children.

      He continues to impress me with his ability to keep up with the trends and market and has given me a greater understanding of the emerging Bitcoin market in general.

      I trust his guidance and his enthusiasm inspires me to continue investing my time energy and money!

      I trust his venture into this Crypto world will pay off with high dividends!"

"I want to first say that I had the best first hour of my training to trade cryptocurrencies. I learned so much in that first hour and watched the market move in the most ( in my opinion) exciting way. Although I would have been afraid to trade at that level, Matthew guided me through the proper way of seeing when to get in on a trade and when to get out. I am so confident that I will be able to trade soon with Matthew's guidance and instructions. I honestly believe that I will get to the level of trading cryptocurrencies that I want soon than I thought I would. Thank you Matthew."

  "matthew  – thanks so much for letting me know about Coby, Midas Touch and this telegram group!  After striking out a few times with other PAID signals groups that don’t deliver, I’m happy to find you.  With Crypto Jack, I was supposed to get 3-5 signals a week.  So far in August, I’ve received only 3 signals!  With Onetrpreneur – he took my money 3 weeks before the program started, and lots of issues with his availability since.  Both young guys – good guys, I think – but not quite able to deliver. This Telegram group is actually FREE and you have over-delivered in terms of signals and transparency.  Honestly, I’m a bit overwhelmed.  But definitely pleased."
